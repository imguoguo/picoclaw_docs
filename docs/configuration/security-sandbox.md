# Security Sandbox

PicoClaw runs in a sandboxed environment by default. The agent can only access files and execute commands within the configured workspace.

## Default Configuration

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "~/.picoclaw/workspace",
      "restrict_to_workspace": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | `~/.picoclaw/workspace` | Working directory for the agent |
| `restrict_to_workspace` | `true` | Restrict file/command access to workspace |

## Protected Tools

When `restrict_to_workspace: true`, the following tools are sandboxed:

| Tool | Function | Restriction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_file` | Read files | Only files within workspace |
| `write_file` | Write files | Only files within workspace |
| `list_dir` | List directories | Only directories within workspace |
| `edit_file` | Edit files | Only files within workspace |
| `append_file` | Append to files | Only files within workspace |
| `exec` | Execute commands | Command paths must be within workspace |

## Additional Exec Protection

Even with `restrict_to_workspace: false`, the `exec` tool blocks these dangerous commands:

- `rm -rf`, `del /f`, `rmdir /s` — Bulk deletion
- `format`, `mkfs`, `diskpart` — Disk formatting
- `dd if=` — Disk imaging
- Writing to `/dev/sd[a-z]` — Direct disk writes
- `shutdown`, `reboot`, `poweroff` — System shutdown
- Fork bomb `:(){ :|:& };:`

### Error Examples

```
[ERROR] tool: Tool execution failed
{tool=exec, error=Command blocked by safety guard (path outside working dir)}
```

```
[ERROR] tool: Tool execution failed
{tool=exec, error=Command blocked by safety guard (dangerous pattern detected)}
```

## Disabling Restrictions

:::warning Security Risk
Disabling this restriction allows the agent to access any path on your system. Use with caution in controlled environments only.
:::

**Method 1: Config file**

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "restrict_to_workspace": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Method 2: Environment variable**

```bash
export PICOCLAW_AGENTS_DEFAULTS_RESTRICT_TO_WORKSPACE=false
```

## Security Boundary Consistency

The `restrict_to_workspace` setting applies consistently across all execution paths:

| Execution Path | Security Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Main Agent | `restrict_to_workspace` ✅ |
| Subagent / Spawn | Inherits same restriction ✅ |
| Heartbeat tasks | Inherits same restriction ✅ |

All paths share the same workspace restriction — there's no way to bypass the security boundary through subagents or scheduled tasks.
